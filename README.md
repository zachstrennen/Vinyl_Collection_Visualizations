This is for personal use. I have assembled a dataset of my vinyl collection with the specific attribites that I want (Discogs' data features are very insufficient).
I imported the data into R and created scripts to show me data visualizations of my collection.
The main purpose of these scripts is to practice creating visualizations with ggplot2 on something unique to myself.
