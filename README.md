# Vinyl Collection Visualizations
This is for personal use. I have assembled a dataset of my vinyl collection with the specific attribites that I want (Discogs' data features are very limited).
I imported the data into R and created scripts to show me data visualizations of my collection.
The main purpose of these scripts is to practice creating visualizations with ggplot2 on.

All packages needed are at the top of the visualizations file.
